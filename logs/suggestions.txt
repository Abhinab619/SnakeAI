1. Openness



# Already calculated in get_state()
# free_ahead, free_left, free_right: values 0 to 1

openness_score = free_ahead + 0.5 * (free_left + free_right)
if openness_score < 0.5:
    reward -= 0.5  # risky path
elif openness_score > 2.0:
    reward += 0.2  # open area





2. Small reward for approaching food

âœ… How To Do It:
ðŸ”§ 1. Track Previous Distance to Food
In your SnakeGameAI class, add this to __init__():

python
Copy
Edit
self.prev_distance_to_food = None
ðŸ§  2. Calculate Distance in play_step()
Update this logic after moving the snake, but before checking for food:

python
Copy
Edit
# Calculate distance to food
current_distance = abs(self.head.x - self.food.x) + abs(self.head.y - self.food.y)

if self.prev_distance_to_food is not None:
    if current_distance < self.prev_distance_to_food:
        reward += 0.2  # Moved closer to food
    elif current_distance > self.prev_distance_to_food:
        reward -= 0.1  # Moved away from food

self.prev_distance_to_food = current_distance  # Update for next step
You can use Manhattan Distance as above, or Euclidean (math.sqrt(...)) if you prefer, but Manhattan is simpler and aligns well with the grid nature of the game.

âœ… 3. Reset on Eating Food
Inside this block:

python
Copy
Edit
if self.head == self.food:
    self.score += 1
    reward = 10
    self._place_food()
    self.steps_since_food = 0
    self.prev_distance_to_food = None  # Reset after eating



(have to add the openness logic as it is still hitting its body at around 250 games and 6.5 avg score)
